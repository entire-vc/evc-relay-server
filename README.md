# Relay Server

[Relay](https://relay.md) adds real-time collaboration to Obsidian. Share exactly the folders you want, keep the rest of your vault private, and work together even when offline. The server in this repository powers that experience.

Relay Server is a fork of [jamsocket/y-sweet](https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet). It exposes the same CRDT-based document store under a new name and integrates with Relay's Control Plane for authentication and permissions.

## Fork origin

This repository (`entire-vc/evc-relay-server`) is a fork of [`No-Instructions/relay-server`](https://github.com/No-Instructions/relay-server).

**Upstream commit pinned:** [`5d4fd161604dde305ac45f200eb8eca09c7c7f15`](https://github.com/No-Instructions/relay-server/commit/5d4fd161604dde305ac45f200eb8eca09c7c7f15) (2026-07-06)

## Self-hosting

> :information_source: **Note:** The Relay Server and Relay Obsidian Plugin are open source, but the Relay Control Plane is not open source. Using a Self-Hosted Relay Server with more than 3 collaborators requires a paid license to support the development of Relay.


Self-hosting within your private network gives you complete privacy for your documents and attachments. Relay's Control Plane handles login and permissions, but cannot read your content.

### Quick-start

```
# mounts local volume, see production deployment guide for S3-compatible storage
docker run \
  -v data:/app/data \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  docker.system3.md/relay-server \
  http://relay-server.my-network.internal:8080  # Your internal network URL
```

Register your server using the Relay Obsidian plugin:

1. Log in
2. Run the command `Relay: Register self-hosted Relay Server`
3. Enter the relay-server URL (must match above)


Don't expose the Relay Server to the public internet.

### Production deployment

The recommended setup uses Docker with Cloudflare R2 for persistence.

See [relay-server-template](https://github.com/no-instructions/relay-server-template) for detailed hosting instructions and deployment templates.


## Features

 - Real-time collaboration engine built atop y-crdt, enabling high-performance conflict-free shared editing
 - Use the Relay.md control plane for login and access control management
 - Fully private self-hosting of your documents and attachments (no connection to the public internet required!)
 - 1-step deployment into your Tailscale Tailnet
 - Persistence to S3-compatible object storage (S3, Cloudflare R2, Minio)
 - Flexible deployment/isolation with single server or session-per-document model
 - Python SDK
 - Webhook Event Delivery
